Group Work to Use Publicly Available Claims Data to Predict Reimbursement Rate of Insurers

Uploaded this code as a personal resource to recall how to approach various problems.

visits in NH in 2016. The data was publicly available and anonymized. Original data had 18MM rows of patient visits to NH hospitals.
